<h1 align="center">shellScripts</h1>

<p>This is my first repo. I decided to try out Github while <a href="https://linuxjourney.com/">learning Linux</a>. Most of the scripts here are going to be very simplistic, e.g. closing applications, installing a bunch of packages (in <a href="https://solus-project.com/home/">Solus</a>), creating log files, etc.</p>
